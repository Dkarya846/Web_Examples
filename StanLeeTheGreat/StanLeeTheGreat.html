            <h1 align=left>Stan Lee(Stanley Martin Lieber)</h1>
                <p>
                Stan Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, and publisher who was active from the 1940s to the 2010s. He rose through the ranks
                of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division 
                of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics industry.
                
                In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous popularional 
                characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor
                Strange, and Ant-Man. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s
                he challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued 
                development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a 
                public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in movies based on Marvel characters, on which he received an 
                honorary "executive producer" credit. Meanwhile, he continued independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018.
                    
                Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He 
                received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.</p>

                <h1>About Life</h1>
                <p>
                Stanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish 
                immigrant parents, Celia (née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan.
                His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression,and the family moved further uptown 
                to Fort Washington Avenue,in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother named Larry Lieber.He said in 2006 
                that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles. By the time Lee
                was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee described it as "a third-floor
                apartment facing out back". Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.
                Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained dreams of one day writing
                the "Great American Novel".He said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and
                press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller
                Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway and selling subscriptions
                to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper.At fifteen, Lee entered a high school essay competition sponsored by the New York 
                Herald Tribune, called "The Biggest News of the Week Contest." Lee claims to have won the prize for three straight weeks, goading
                the newspaper to write him and ask him to let someone else win. The paper suggested he look into writing professionally, which 
                Lee claims "probably changed my life."He graduated from high school early, aged 16½ in 1939, and joined the WPA Federal 
                Theatre Project.

                    another version of the scene was filmed where Stark realizes his mistake, but Lee graciously responds, "That's okay,
                    I get this all the time."In 2008, Stan Lee named this as his favorite cameo appearance to that date.

                        character. However, Lee began his writing career in the character's original series where he created the idea of Captain 
                        America using his shield as a throwing weapon. Furthermore, he was responsible for reviving the character in the Silver Age
                        of Comic Books and co-wrote most of the character's stories in The Avengers and his solo stories in that period.

        <p id="pofcomic">Stan Lee first became involved in comics in 1939, when he was given work as an assistant at what was then
            Timely Comics. He was published for the first time in 1941, when he produced text filler for Captain America
            Comics #3. He wrote his first published comic two months later, which was followed by his first co-creation,
            Destroyer, in August. Towards the end of that year he was given the position of interim editor of Timely 
            following the departure of Joe Simon. Through the 1950s he wrote various comics in a variety of genres for
            what was now known as Atlas Comics. 1961 saw a shift in the works he produced when he was instructed to create 
            superhero team. Deviating from the norm of superheroes as idealized icons, Lee and artist Jack Kirby produced a 
            superteam that was more distinctly human and flawed: the Fantastic Four. This team proved incredibly popular, 
            and Lee capitalized on his success with a whole host of new heroes created alongside a variety of artists, 
            including the Hulk, the X-Men, and Spider-Man, among numerous others.</p>

        <h1>About Personal Life of Stan Lee</h1>
        <p>Lee was raised in a Jewish family. In a 2002 survey of whether he believed in God, he stated, "Well, let 
            me put it this way No, I'm not going to try to be clever. I really don't know. I just don't
            know."<br>
            From 1945 to 1947, Lee lived in the rented top floor of a brownstone in the East 90s in Manhattan.
            He married Joan Clayton Boocock on December 5, 1947 and in 1949, the couple bought a house in
            Woodmere, New York, on Long Island, living there through 1952. Their daughter Joan Celia "J. C." Lee
            was born in 1950. Another daughter, Jan Lee, died three days after delivery in 1953.<br>
            
            The Lees resided in the Long Island town of Hewlett Harbor, New York, from 1952 to 1980.They also
            owned a condominium on East 63rd Street in Manhattan from 1975 to 1980, and during the 1970s owned
            a vacation home in Remsenburg, New York. For their move to the West Coast in 1981, they bought a 
            home in West Hollywood, California, previously owned by comedian Jack Benny's radio announcer Don Wilson.<br>
            
            In September 2012, Lee underwent an operation to insert a pacemaker, which required cancelling planned 
            appearances at conventions.<br>
            
            On July 6, 2017, his wife of 69 years, Joan, died of complications from a stroke. She was 95 years old.
            In April 2018, The Hollywood Reporter published a report that claimed Lee was a victim of elder abuse; 
            the report asserted that among others, Keya Morgan, business manager of Lee and a memorabilia collector,
            had been isolating Lee from his trusted friends and associates following his wife's death, to get access
            to Lee's wealth, estimated to be worth US$50 million. In August 2018, Morgan was issued a restraining 
            order to stay away from Lee, his daughter, or his associates for three years.<br>

        <p class="pofquotes">Some of Inspiring Quotes Of Stan Lee</p><br><br>
        <pre>No one has a perfect life. Everybody has something that he wishes was not the way it is.</pre>
        <pre>Life is never completely without its challenges.</pre>
        <pre>If you are interested in what you do, that keeps you going!</pre>
        <pre>The only advice anybody can give is, if you wanna be a writer, keep
             writing. And read all you can, read everything.</pre>
        <pre>All I thought about when I wrote my stories was, “I hope that these
             comic books would sell so I can keep my job and continue to pay the 
             rent.” Never in a million years could I have imagined that it would 
             turn into what it has evolved into nowadays. Never.</pre>
        <pre>With great power comes great responsibilty. </pre>
        <pre>I’m happiest when I’m working. If I’m not working, I feel like I’m wasting my time.</pre>
        <pre>The more you read, the better you’re going to become as a storyteller.</pre>
        <pre>I had been writing comic books for years and I was doing them to please
             a publisher, who felt that comics are only read by very young children 
             stupid adults. And therefore, we have to keep the stories very simplistic.
             And that was the thing I hated.</pre>
        <pre>If I got a superpower I wouldn’t say, oh, I got to get a costume and put
             on a mask. I would say hey, I can do something better than other people. 
             How can I turn it into a buck?</pre>
