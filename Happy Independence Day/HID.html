		The 15th of August is one of the most important dates in the history of our country. It is the day<br> we became independent from British rule. On the midnight of this day in the year 1947, Pandit <br>Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled the National Flag at the Red Fort to mark the freedom of our country.<br>
		The whole country was rejoicing.<br><br>
		The freedom fighters of our country gave up their lives to end the British rule in India. They finally<br>
		won their cause on the 15th of August, 1947. Every year when we celebrate this day, we remember the <br> sacrifices that they made, and pay homage to them.<br><br>
		The Independence Day is declared as a public holiday. The national Flag files high  and proud from the<br>
	 	tops of schools and official buildings. Speeches are given, the National Anthem is sung, and sweets<br>  are distributed among everyone.<br><br>
        The celebration is even more marked in New Delhi. The Prime Minister of the country gives a speech<br> from the Red Fort every year on this day. A large number of people from all over the country gather<br>in the parade Ground to hear him.<br><br>
 		The Independence Day reminds us all that we are the citizens of a great country, and we must do our<br>
 		best to preserve her unity. We must respect our National Flag and National Anthem. We must also<br>
 		try to be patriotic like the people who fought for the freedom of our country. Let us all be proud of India.<br><br>

		The mere mention of this date, 15th August, fills our heart with immense pride and acknowledgment<br> of the lives sacrificed during the course of the freedom movement. We owe this freedom to our<br> valiant freedom fighters who didn't hesitate for once to give up their lives, just so their future<br> generations can breathe the free air of India.<br><br>

		The Indian self-rule movement was a mass-based movement that encompassed various sections<br>
	    of society. It also underwent a process of constant ideological evolution. Once Indians decided<br>
	    to be free of British Raj, the firangis had no option but to leave the country, however, it was not<br>easy. Lord Mountbatten had been given a mandate by the British parliament to transfer the power by<br> June 30, 1948. Watching the impatience of the people, Mountbatten knew, if he had waited till June<br> 1948, in C Rajagopalachari’s memorable words, there would have been no power left to transfer, which<br>is why he advanced the date to August 1947.<br><br>

		It was not easy for the Britishers to give up power and accept the defeat so they camouflaged it in<br> the name of stopping the bloodshed. Mountbatten claimed that by advancing the date, he was ensuring<br> that there will be no bloodshed or riot. Although he was proven wrong later. He tried to justify<br> himself saying,<br>
		 “wherever colonial rule has ended, there has been bloodshed. That is the price you pay.”<br><br>

		The Indian Independence Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons on July 4, 1947, and<br> passed within 15 days. On August 15, 1947, the British rule over India ended and marked history.<br><br>

		Independence Day is a day when people in India pay homage to their leaders and those who fought for<br>
		India's freedom in the past. The period leading up to Independence Day is a time when major government<br>
		buildings are illuminated with strings of lights and the tricolor flutters from homes and other<br> buildings. Broadcast, print and online media may have special contests, programs, and articles to<br> promote the day. Movies about India's freedom fighters are also shown on television.<br><br>
        The president delivers the '"Address to the Nation" on the eve of Independence Day. India's prime<br> minister unfurls India's flag and holds a speech at the Red Fort in Old Dehli. Flag hoisting <br>ceremonies and cultural programs are held in the state capitals and often involve many schools and organizations.<br><br>
		Many people spend the day with family members or close friends. They may eat a picnic in a park or<br>
		private garden, go to a film or eat lunch or dinner at home or in a restaurant. Other people go kite<br> flying or sing or listen to patriotic songs.<br></p>
